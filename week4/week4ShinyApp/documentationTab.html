<li>The Shiny application developed for the week 4 assignment "Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch" proposes a data vizualization of the Diamonds dataset distribution as well as linear models to model the relationship between carat and price.</li>
<li>The user can set the size of the random sample used to build the models of the carat / price relationship. THe default sample size is set to 100. The full Diamonds dataset comprises 53,940 records.</li>
<li>The Slidify presentation pitch can be found <a href="https://bluebonobo.github.io/coursera_hopkins_developingdataproducts/#(1)">here</a> </li>
<li>The Shiny application can be found <a href="https://bluebonobo.shinyapps.io/week4shinyapp/">here</a> </li>
</ul>

<li>The calculation done on the server are located in the file server.R locate in github <a href="https://github.com/bluebonobo/coursera_hopkins_developingdataproducts/tree/main/week4/week4ShinyApp">here</a></li>
<li>The application build one linear regression model per cut quality</li>
<li>Each model is then represented with its error on the scatter plot</li>
<li>Models can be isolated by selected the type of cut in the legend</li>
</ul>
